# classList.js [DEPRECATED]

classList.js is a cross-browser JavaScript shim that fully implements `element.classList`. Refer to [the MDN page on `element.classList`][1] for more information.

# Reasons for fork

Is to fix IE bug. https://github.com/eligrey/classList.js/compare/master...MyMedsAndMe:classList.js:master.

But wether we use it somewhere or not is not clear. 

# Oficial readme

This works in every browser except IE 7 or earlier.
